# [Topic 03]: Creating simple MVC application in PHP
Under this topic, we tackle series of lessons that eventually build up into a simple model-view-controller applciation in PHP.
We will begin the topic by defining model objects that represent our database entities. We will add a simple configuration to establish a connection to our database.
With that in place, we then look at adding repository classes to help manage the resources in our data storage.
And then, we will create controller classes to convey data resources to the web views.
